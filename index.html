    This page is a companion to a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-wQVEjH9yuhanpyQjUwQS1JOTQ/view">
    recent paper by Hardt, Price, Srebro</a>, which discusses ways to define and
    remove discrimination by improving machine learning systems.
  </div>

  <p>
As machine learning is increasingly used to make important
decisions across core social domains, the work of ensuring
    that these decisions aren't discriminatory becomes crucial.
  <p>
Here we discuss "threshold classifiers," a part of some machine
    learning systems that is critical to issues of discrimination.
    A threshold classifier essentially makes a yes/no decision,
    putting things in one category or another.
    We look at how these classifiers work, ways they can
    potentially be unfair, and how you might turn an unfair
    classifier into a fairer one. As an illustrative example,
    we focus on loan granting scenarios where a bank may grant
    or deny a loan based on a single, automatically computed number
    such as a credit score.

In the diagram above, dark dots represent people who would
    pay off a loan, and the light dots those who wouldn't.
    In an ideal world, we would work with statistics that
    cleanly separate categories as in the left example.
    Unfortunately, it is far more common to see the situation
    at the right, where the groups overlap.
  <p>

A single statistic can stand in for many different variables,
    boiling them down to one number. In the case of a credit score,
    which is computed looking at a number of factors, including income,
    promptness in paying debts, etc., the number might correctly represent
    the likelihood that a person will pay off a loan, or default.
    Or it might not. The relationship is usually fuzzy&mdash;it's rare to
    find a statistic that correlates perfectly with real-world outcomes.
  <p>
This is where the idea of a "threshold classifier" comes in:
    the bank picks a particular cut-off, or threshold,
    and people whose credit scores are below it are denied the loan,
    and people above it are granted the loan. (Obviously real banks
    have many additional complexities, but this simple model
    is useful for studying some of the fundamental issues.
    And just to be clear, Google doesn't use credit scores
    in its own products.)

   The diagram above uses synthetic data to show how a threshold classifier works.
   (To simplify the explanation, we're staying away from real-life credit
   scores or data--what you see shows simulated data with a zero-to-100
   based "score".) As you can see, picking a threshold requires
   some tradeoffs. Too low, and the bank gives loans to many people
   who default. Too high, and many people who deserve a loan won't get one.
  <p>
    So what is the best threshold? It depends. One goal might be to
    maximize the number of correct decisions.
    (What threshold does that in this example?)
    <p>
     Another goal, in a financial situation, could be to maximize
     profit. At the bottom of the diagram is a readout of
     a hypothetical "profit", based on a model where a successful
     loan makes $300, but a default costs the bank $700. What
     is the most profitable threshold? Does it match the threshold
     with the most correct decisions?


<h1 id="groups-section">Classification and Discrimination</h1>

     The issue of how "the correct" decision is defined,
     and with sensitivities to which factors,
     becomes particularly thorny when a statistic
     like a credit score ends up distributed differently between two groups.
     <p>
     Imagine we have two groups of people, "blue" and "orange."
       We are interested in making small loans, subject to the
       following rules:
    <ul>
      <li>A successful loan makes $300</li>
      <li>An unsuccessful loan costs $700</li>
      <li>Everyone has a credit score between 0 and 100</li>
    </ul>

In this case, the distributions of the two groups are slightly
      different, even though blue and orange people are equally
      likely to pay off a loan. If you look for pair of thresholds
      that maximize total profit (or click the "max profit" button) you'll
      see that the blue group is held to a higher standard
      than the orange one.
    <p>
    That could be a problem&mdash;and one obvious solution for the bank
    not to just pick thresholds to make as much money as possible.

    Another approach would be to implement a
      <span class="title">group-unaware</span>, which holds
      all groups to the same standard. Is this really
      the right solution, though? For one thing,
      if there are real differences between two groups,
      it might not be fair to ignore them&mdash;for example,
      women generally pay less for life insurance than men,
      since they tend to live longer.
      <p>
        But there are other,
      mathematical problems with a group-unaware approach even
      if both groups are equally loan-worthy. In the example above,
      the differences in score distributions means that the orange group actually
      gets fewer loans when the bank looks for the
      most profitable group-unaware threshold.
    <p>
    If the goal is for the two groups to receive the same number of loans,
    then a natural criterion is <span class="title">demographic parity</span>,
    where the bank uses loan thresholds that yield the
    same fraction of loans to each group. Or, as a computer scientist
    might put it, the "positive rate" is the same across both groups.

    <p>
    In some contexts, this might be the right goal. In the situation in the diagram,
    though, there's still something problematic: a demographic parity
    constraint only looks at loans given, not rates at which loans
    are paid back. In this case, the criterion results in
    fewer qualified people in the blue group
    being given loans than in the orange group.
    <p>
    To avoid this situation, the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B-wQVEjH9yuhanpyQjUwQS1JOTQ/view">paper by Hardt, Price, Srebro<a/> defines a
      concept called <span class="title">equal opportunity</span>. Here, the constraint is that of
      the people who can pay back a loan, the same fraction in each group should actually
      be granted a loan. Or, in data science jargon, the "true positive rate" is
      identical between groups.

  <p>
  <h1 id="conclusion-section">Improving machine learning systems</h1>
A key result in the paper by Hardt, Price, and Srebro shows
      that&mdash;given essentially any scoring system&mdash;it's
      possible to efficiently find thresholds that meet any of these criteria.
      In other words, even if you don't have control over the underlying
      scoring system (a common case) it's still possible to attack
      the issue of discrimination.
<p>
For organizations that do have control over the scoring system,
  using these definitions can help clarify core issues.
  If a classifier isn't as effective for some groups as others,
  it can cause problems for the groups with the most uncertainty.
  Restricting to equal opportunity thresholds transfers the "burden of
  uncertainty" away from these groups and onto the creators of
  the scoring system. Doing so provides an incentive to invest
  in better classifiers.<p>

This work is just one step in a long chain of research.
      Optimizing for equal opportunity is just one of many tools
      that can be used to improve machine learning systems&mdash;and
      mathematics alone is unlikely to lead to the best solutions.
      Attacking discrimination in machine learning will ultimately
      require a careful, multidisciplinary approach.
